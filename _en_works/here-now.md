"Voice Caves in the City" is a space-specific voice performance that moves with the audience in search for places with cave-like acoustics all over the city.

The performance invites the audience to a sensitive world of resonance that blooms when the venue's soundsociety and instinctive sounds made with the audience through connected, yet independent voice improvisations. This healing show can restore the lost instincts of life.
