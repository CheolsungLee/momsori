### 1. Searching for my true voice

Deliberation of myself by deliberating my voice

### 2. Songs of water, fire, wind and earth

connecting myself with 4 fundamental elements of Nature by using my voice resonance.

### 3. Song of your shadows

Facing hidden your energies, hidden yourselves  inside your body-mind.
Giving your voice to different shadows of you, make them sing.
