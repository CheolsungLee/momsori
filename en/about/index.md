### Troupe


MOMSORI is a performance art troupe that creates and presents pieces crossing the borders of theater and music using voice as the main medium. Kim Jin-young, a graduate of the School of Visual Theater in Jerusalem, Israel, that established CCOT with Lee Cheol-sung and created various performances, established the troupe in 2008 after leaving CCOT.

MOMSORI creates performances with the idea that the human voice can de the main material for art and lead the process of creation as well as having healing characteristics that connect the body and mind. Under the same notion, for more than a decades, KIM Jin-young have been giving voice training courses for professionals and voice therapy courses for everyone who want to discover their hidden energy through voice.
